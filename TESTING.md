# Arrow Tauri Migration - Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing instructions for the migrated Arrow posture monitoring application.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Rust**: Latest stable version with Cargo
- **Node.js**: v18+ with npm
- **Python 3**: With mediapipe and opencv-python packages
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows with desktop environment

### Development Dependencies
```bash
# Install Tauri CLI (optional, for development)
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0"

# Install frontend dependencies
cd arrow-client && npm install
```

## Testing Components

### 1. Backend Unit Tests
Test the core Rust backend functionality:

```bash
cd arrow-client/src-tauri
cargo test
```

**Expected Output:**
- Posture enum conversion tests ✓
- String-to-posture conversion tests ✓  
- Database operations tests ✓

### 2. Frontend Build Test
Verify the React frontend compiles correctly:

```bash
cd arrow-client
npm run build
```

**Expected Output:**
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Vite build successful with bundled assets

### 3. Backend Compilation Test
Verify the Tauri backend compiles:

```bash
cd arrow-client/src-tauri
cargo build
```

**Expected Output:**
- Successful compilation with minimal warnings
- Binary created in `target/debug/`

## Integration Testing

### Option 1: Test Server (Recommended for Development)
Use the provided test server that simulates posture data without requiring a camera:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the test server
python3 test_server.py

# Terminal 2: Start the Tauri application
cd arrow-client
npm run tauri dev
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Test server starts on `127.0.0.1:9876`
2. Tauri app launches with loading screen
3. Connection indicator shows "Connected" 
4. Posture display alternates between good/bad posture every 2 seconds
5. Session history updates with posture changes
6. Desktop notifications appear for posture changes

### Option 2: Real Camera Testing
Use the original Python server with actual camera input:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Install Python dependencies and start server
cd server
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py

# Terminal 2: Start the Tauri application  
cd arrow-client
npm run tauri dev
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Python server starts camera capture
2. Real-time posture detection based on your movements
3. Desktop notifications for actual posture changes
4. Database logging of your session

## Functional Testing Checklist

### ✅ Startup & Initialization
- [ ] Application launches without errors
- [ ] Loading screen appears during initialization
- [ ] Database is created/connected successfully
- [ ] TCP client attempts connection to server

### ✅ Connection Management
- [ ] Connection indicator shows correct status
- [ ] Automatic reconnection attempts when server is unavailable
- [ ] Manual refresh button updates connection status
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful

### ✅ Posture Monitoring
- [ ] Posture display updates in real-time
- [ ] SVG icons change based on posture (good_posture.svg vs bad_posture.svg)
- [ ] Posture message updates correctly
- [ ] Metrics information displays visibility percentages

### ✅ Desktop Notifications
- [ ] Notification permission requested on first run
- [ ] "Well done!" notification for good posture
- [ ] "Bad posture!" notification with specific issue
- [ ] Notifications clear appropriately

### ✅ Session History
- [ ] Session logs display recent posture changes
- [ ] Duration formatting is human-readable (e.g., "2m 30s")
- [ ] Good vs bad posture color coding works
- [ ] Manual refresh updates the history
- [ ] Summary shows total entries and good posture time

### ✅ Data Persistence
- [ ] Session start/end logged to database
- [ ] Posture changes logged with timestamps
- [ ] Database survives application restart
- [ ] Session history persists between runs

### ✅ Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful handling when server is unavailable
- [ ] Clean shutdown when application closes
- [ ] No memory leaks or hanging processes
- [ ] Frontend error boundaries catch React errors

## Performance Testing

### Memory Usage
Monitor memory consumption during extended use:

```bash
# Run the application and monitor with system tools
# Linux: htop, ps aux | grep arrow
# macOS: Activity Monitor
# Windows: Task Manager
```

**Expected Results:**
- Stable memory usage under 100MB
- No significant memory leaks over time
- CPU usage < 5% during idle monitoring

### Network Performance
Test TCP connection stability:

```bash
# Monitor network connections
ss -tuln | grep 9876  # Linux
netstat -an | grep 9876  # macOS/Windows
```

**Expected Results:**
- Stable TCP connection maintained
- Quick reconnection after server restart
- No connection flooding or excessive retries

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Failed to initialize notifications"
- **Cause**: Desktop notification permissions not granted
- **Solution**: Allow notifications in system settings, restart app

### "Connection failed: Connection refused"
- **Cause**: Python server not running or wrong port
- **Solution**: Start server first, verify port 9876 is available

### "Database not initialized"
- **Cause**: Insufficient filesystem permissions
- **Solution**: Check write permissions in user data directory

### Build Errors
- **Rust compilation fails**: Update Rust with `rustup update`
- **Frontend build fails**: Clear `node_modules` and reinstall
- **Missing dependencies**: Install system packages for Tauri

## Migration Verification

Compare functionality with original Iced application:

| Feature | Original Iced | Tauri Migration | Status |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Real-time posture display | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Complete |
| Desktop notifications | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Complete |
| Session history | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Enhanced |
| Database logging | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Complete |
| TCP server connection | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Complete |
